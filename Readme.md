This is a canvas library which anybody can use in browser to integrate drawing basic shapes functionality into your web applications such as Box, Triangle, Lines, Circle, ellipsis and change circle x and y radius using just your mouse to draw and enable shapes to draw using keyboard keys controls as follows as well as undo and redo your drawing from start to end.

Highlights:

<li> No dependencies on other packages</li>
<li> Supported in Chrome, Firefox and Edge Browsers</li>
<li> Integrate drawing and moving shapes functionality into your web application in seconds</li>
